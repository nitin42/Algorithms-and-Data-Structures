# Design-of-algorithms
Contains sorting, graph, divide &amp; conquer, greedy and mathematical algorithms. All the algorithms are implemented in Python programming language with proper tests.


## Why algorithms and how they work?

```
def Algorithm(problem):
	flag = False
	while not flag or not fast_enough(running_time):
		algorithm = devise_algorithm(problem)
		correctness = check_correctness(algorithm)
		running_time = check_running_time(algorithm)

	return algorithm 
```
